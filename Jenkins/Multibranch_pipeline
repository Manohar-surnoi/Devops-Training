This multibranch pipeline enables us to implement different jenkinsfiles for different branches of the same project
In this pipeline, jenkins automatically discovers, manages, and executes pipelines for branches in Git hub
PR based: Branches get discovered automatically in the pipeline if someone raises PR(Pull Request)
The main advantage of using multibranch pipeline is to build and deploy multiple branches from single repository
